* Monday
** What is version control
** Configuring git
- git config --global user.name "First Last"

- git config --global color.ui "auto"
** Create a repository
*** git init

*** git diff
*** git log
** Notes
*** Staging area
*** commit messages
*** Directories
** Retrieve previous versions
*** git checkout
** ignoring things
*** .gitignore
* Wednesday
** Branches
*** Why?
- separate work thematically
- think of it as a "sub-repository"
- works best when changes are orthogonal
- best practice: don't merge into =master= until things are tested and
  complete.
*** How
- =git branch=
- =git checkout -b=
*** Merges
- copies work from one branch into another.
*** Resolving Conflicts
** Remotes
*** Again, why?
- multiple people 
- multiple machines
- sharing is caring
*** Push and pull
- pull is fetch and merge
- push sends one or more branches
*** github
- a place for repositories
*** Fork
- make a github copy
*** Pull Request
- literally, a request for someone else to pull
