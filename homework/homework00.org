-----
* Getting access to the cluster
Point a web browser to https://atlacamani.marietta.edu:8000 and log in. Your username is your MC email username (your email address without the @marietta.edu), and your initial password is your student ID.
-----
* Change your initial password on the cluster
- Once you have logged in to the dashboard, select New -> Terminal.
- In the terminal window, type `passwd`, and then follow the instructions to change your password.

-----
* Getting access to a shell on your own computer 
- If you have a Mac, find the Terminal app. By default, it's in the /Other/ group accessible in the Launchpad.
- If you have a Windows machine, download and install Git for Windows. It includes a bash shell, and we will need it later anyway.
