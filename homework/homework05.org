* A python of your own
Install Anaconda on your own computer if you have not already done so.
-----


* Required packages
We will be using a number of external python libraries over the course of the rest of the semester.
Install the following packages via anaconda.  (You do not need to do anything to have these installed
on the cluster; they're already there.)

| notebook | numpy | matplotlib | scipy       |
| pandas   | h5py  | sympy      | statsmodels |
------


* Consistent environments
- Figure out which version of each of the 8 libraries listed above is running on the cluster.
- Figure out which version of python is running on the cluster.
- Create a conda environment from within anaconda; make sure it matches the version of python on the cluster and call it PHYS381.
- Make your environment consistent with the cluster by installing the appropriate versions of the above 8 libraries.

There's more than one way to do this. You may find the [[https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html][relevant conda documentation]] helpful.
