* Broaden your toolbox
Find and read the manual pages (either using the man command or on the web) for the following commands:
| df | du   | cat  | more | less |
| ps | sort | uniq | find | grep |

Add the commands to your cheat sheet.[fn::If they're not there
already. A few of these were covered in the Software Carpentry lessons
you did for Homework 01.] 
-----
* Apply what you've learned
Using some combination of the above commands (optionally with pipes), figure out:
- which subdirectory of =data-shell= is the biggest?
- How many processes are currently running that are owned by =root=? by
  =cmckay=? by =cptn_caboose=?
- How much free space is on the root filesystem?
- How much free space is on =/warehouse=?

Put these questions (and their answers) into a file called hw_02.md in
an appropriate place under your =PHYS381= directory. Use markdown to
format them in a sensible way.
-----
* Begin formatting your cheat sheet
In an approprate place under your =PHYS381= directory, create a file
called =00_shell.md=. Using *at least* headings and lists, begin
formatting the information you've already collected. You may use
whatever other markdown features you find helpful.

At the end of your cheat sheet, include a references section that has
links to one or two (or more) places on the web you have found useful
information about the shell so far.[fn::Software carpentry is probably
a good first choice here.]
